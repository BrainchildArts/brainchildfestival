      name: "Steez"
      image: "data/friends/steez.jpg"
      bio: "Steez is something very special and dear to our hearts. A space where anyone can feel free to create, and a network of appreciative, bright and forward thinking people. Every month now, hundreds of people come together to share their love of performing, writing, composing or listening. It’s been a big journey since the days in the Honor Oak pub, but even then, there something was special and the pub was always packed. Back then Steez was run by Southpaw, and although they had played the first Brainchild and brought along a short program of poetry, it wasn’t until our second festival that we fully decided to collaborate and bring these two projects together. It was the perfect fit.</p><p>Luke Newman came on board to do music programming with us in a big way. We had the idea to make the Steez Cafe, a physical space at the festival to bring forth collaboration and that openness to connect with people. The Steez Cafe appeared again at our relaunch in January 2014, and will be back even stronger than before at the 2015 festival.</p><p>From our chance meeting with Luke at the (since deceased) Cable nightclub in 2011, it feels almost surreal to look at how much has happened, and how inspirational the partnership has proven to be. At the moment, we are working together to launch a whole new interdisciplinary, commission-based project which will manifest in 2015, and continue to support each other in any way that we can."

      bio: "Whirlygig Cinema is a lovely organisation headed up by Katie Steed, dedicated to promoting emerging film talent through interesting and interactive events. It is their work with The Cabinet of Living Cinema, creating and performing new soundtracks to short films, that first attracted us to Whirlygig. The films and their re-imagined scores never failed to leave us a little awe-struck.</p><p>They have been very generous to us, kindly pointing us in the direction of filmmakers to work with for our events, and even selecting short programs of films for us to play at our events, notably the re-launch in January 2014 and Mindbaby, in May 2013. Our connection with Whirlygig puts us in better stead for developing innovative ways of incorporating film and cinema into the festival, and for this we thank them very much!"

      name: "Save the Male"
      image: "data/friends/savemale.jpg"
      bio: "Headed up by two of our favourite people, Cecilia Knapp and Jack Rooke, Save The Male is a comedy, poetry and music showcase raising awareness of the male suicide prevention charity C.A.L.M. (Campaign Against Living Miserably). Together they have taken Save the Male to many festivals, from Brainchild to Bestival. Our biggest collaboration to date was for our slot at LeeFest, where amongst the laughter and the head-bopping, more people were made aware of the fantastic work that C.A.L.M do, and we hopefully helped to break down a weensy bit more of the stigma that can exist around mental health. </p><p>Like us, their work hopes to empower and motivate people through creativity, restoring it as a human resource to combat negative mindsets and connect with other people. We cannot wait to work with them more in the future."

      bio: "For any Bristol based people who like giant colourful chameleons, live music, good food and workshops - Jam Jar Collective, based at The Old Malt House, is a loving home.</p><p>Our first event in Bristol had some very last minute venue changes, and these guys kindly took us in. It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened because they’re all about what we’re about, and their space is quite phenomenal, including a performance area, kitchen, recording studio, rehearsal rooms and living space. We hope to return there for our future Bristol plans, and to have them feature at Brainchild Festival 2015 in a big way."

      name: "LeeFest"
      image: "data/friends/leefest.jpg"
      bio: "We were incredibly excited we got an email from Lee Denny asking us to be part of LeeFest 2014. It was great to see that a festival as well-established and renowned as LeeFest had remained so friendly and so humble. Not only has their non-corporate ethos (demonstrated beautifully by their fantastic kickstarter campaign and ‘Campfire Cabinet’) become a landmark of inspiration for us, but we’ve also been impressed by their drive to work with so many different arts organisations from across different disciplines.</p><p>For 2014, we brought an installation named ‘The Pavillion’, made by Louise Colgan and Roma Swords McDonnell, and a two hour set to the Clocktower stage, which we curated with Save the Male. More collaborative projects between us two festivals are almost certainly going to be emerging next year. "

      bio: "The love that Charlotte and Josh have for finding and promoting new poems and music is infectious. Their ambition and their dedication to the cause have been real inspirations to us. We’ve been incredibly lucky to have their support with Brainchild, whether that’s been with marketing, or easing event stress, they have been continuously generous.</p><p>Josh’s vast array of projects in music and poetry, including Benin City (our 2013 Sunday headliners), Hugh, LV, Paper Tiger, and his solo spoken word performances, are quite phenomenal, and we always hope to keep them involved with the festival.</p><p>Perhaps the most special thing to come out of our relationship to date is the Howl 2.0 show, working with young poets (including James Massiah, Jack Rooke, Cecilia Knapp, Rosie Knight, Kareem Parkins Brown and Dauda Ladejobi) to re-imagine Ginsberg’s unforgettable poem, which was debuted at our 2013 festival."

      name: "Speak Easy"
      image: "data/friends/speakeasy.jpg"
      bio: "Speak Easy is a project dear to our hearts. It was inspired by a night called ‘The Moth’ in New York, and essentially provides opportunities to develop real life experiences into performable stories. People have been telling stories since the beginning of time, and although we all think we’re good listeners, it’s remarkable what giving someone the space, an engaged audience, and five, uninterrupted minutes, can create.</p><p>Through the nights Sophie and Zoe have done with Speak Easy in Bristol, and at our Rich Mix event in August, a growing number of people are telling stories and transforming moving, difficult, poignant or beautiful parts of their past into something shared and appreciated by many."

      name: "Full English Kitchen"
      image: "data/friends/fek.jpg"
      bio: "After a total chance meeting of the wonderful Jacob Davey in June 2013, he very soon fell into place as our bar manager at the festival. His sense of humour and magnetic personality almost certainly played a big part in the buzz around the bar that year, and in turn, to the general levels of insobriety amongst the festival.</p><p>Next thing we knew, he and two other young fellas called Mike and Chris had begun an enterprise called Full English Kitchen, specialising in fantastic, locally sourced food, and amazing cocktails made from home-grown syrup.</p><p>Their hard work at our Re:Launch in January 2014 helped hugely to make the event the success it was, and we cannot wait to have them more involved with the food at the festival."

      name: "The Elektrik Cave"
      image: "data/friends/elktrkcave.jpg"
      bio: "Ever since we crossed paths through courses at the Roundhouse, Erica, founder and presenter of the Elektrik Cave radio show, has been an unceasing support for Brainchild. Through our shared love of hip-hop, poetry, jazz and electronic music, she came to interview many of the musicians from our 2013 lineup on her radio show, and even made an hour-long Brainchild Special in the lead up to the festival.</p><p>Erica has also spread her expertise further than the radio-waves and prompted us to set up Brainchild TV, conducting interviews with artists and crew over the 2013 festival and helping to get our first mini-documentary film, about Slam the Poet, off the ground. We know no other homegrown radio show with smoother or more vibrant playlists, or beautiful presenter."

      bio: "This amazing bunch of LSE and Kings College students have run parties in aid of a load of different charities, including Hostage UK and the Helen Bamber Foundation. They are a team who we have great admiration for, and whose dedication is really remarkable. Like us, they want to explore the ways that art can bring social issues into new light, and we were very happy to have collaborated with them on ‘Cityscapes’, a fundraiser for the Homeless Film Festival."
