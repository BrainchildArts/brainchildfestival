# you did it!

Brainchild is run by a team of passionate volunteers that has grown with the project, spurred on by the end result: a community of participants who respond to our goals as much as we do. Artists have been consistently generous and enthusiastic about sharing their work and their processes, and the organising team have worked long, hard hours to ensure that Brainchild connects and inspires people.

Our first festival was dreamed up in December 2011, and organised from March until its manifestation at the end of June. Most of us were still teenagers at the shallow end of a learning curve, but despite lacking the polish of an established event, the festival exceeded everyone’s expectations.

We were so grateful to the people who’d believed in it and joined us, and it’s largely those people that spurred us on to make the 2013 festival. We relocated to a new site in Canterbury and a whole new community to work with, the community that was developing around the then open-mic night Steez, in Honor Oak. Working with these musicians and poets, and many other artists in theatre, film and installations from universities across the country, we constructed a temporary world in a sunny field where for 700 people, enthusiasm, collaboration, conversation and openness seemed to reverberate everywhere. With three stages featuring live music, jam sessions, spoken word, talks, new theatre, film, workshops and dance music, it really felt as if a community around this project was really taking shape.

Now, having had a year out to finish our various degrees, we are starting to build up to Brainchild Festival #3, in July 2015, and cannot wait to meet all the exciting people who will be part of it.
