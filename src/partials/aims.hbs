We are a young festival and arts organisation dedicated to celebrating and developing creativity. The festival sets out to provide a platform for as many different disciplines of art and ideas as possible, including talks, Q&A’s and workshops in our program as well as live music, spoken word, theatre, film, dance and installations.

Human creativity is a fantastic thing, but sadly it is not always something that people have the opportunity to develop in their every-day lives. At the festival, and in our other work, we aim to find new ways for audiences to engage the art, and for the artists to develop their work. We want to break down the divisions between audience and performer, so that everybody involved will have the opportunity to share skills, ideas and inspirations.

Simply put, our aims are these:

- To develop creativity and build creative confidence.
- To engage with progressive ideas from any discipline.
- To share visions for a more sustainable and compassionate society.
- To provide a platform for as many disciplines as possible.
- To explore the creative process, not just the finished product.
- To build a useful network for artists and individuals to work together beyond festival.

Whether it’s through jamming at the Steez Cafe, taking part in interdisciplinary open-mics, making installations or volunteering as part of the build/break team, Brainchild Festival is a wonderful place to meet like-minded people, let your hair down, and develop interests and talents you may not even knew you had.
