Brainchild is run by a team of passionate volunteers. Over the last two festivals, both artists and organisers have been incredibly generous and enthusiastic about sharing their work and time. Whether it's driving vans, making zines, assembling fencing, lending kit, spending endless hours on photoshop, flyering or spreading the love - it's an almighty team effort.

The management and festival production is mainly undertaken by Marina Blake, Jerome Toole, Joey Valiunas, Rosie Skan, Isabel Adomakoh-Young, Zoe Hunter Gordon and Sarah Wilson. The bulk of the programming is led by Luke Newman (music), Bridget Minamore (poetry), Zoe + Rosie (theatre), Lily Bonesso (installations), Louise Colgan (dance music), Georgia Spencer-Davison (films) and Jerome + Marina (music, talks, workshops and other projects).

Great bundles of thanks and credit must also go out to a whole host of individuals who've contributed in a big, unquantifiable way over time. Thank you Ellen Spence, Sanjay Poyzer, Ed Ive, Erica McKoy, Phoebe Douglas, Rachel Hannah, Rachel Tookey, Robbie Wojciechowski, Tom Benn, Joel Chima (Crack In The Road), Andrew Hulme (Werdna), Josie Tucker and Joe Melhuish for their support in marketing, programming, film production, artwork and more.
