      name: "Cholombian"

      bio: "Soundscapes rooted in HipHop but evoking a very a different kind of reflection. To listen to Cholombian feels like time itself is slowing down, it’s easy to get lost in the world that’s created in between each reverberant drum hit. We love Cholombian so much, he played for us at both of our Festivals so far."

      bio: "Jamie Isaac’s music immerses you into a world of depth and tranquility, evoking a sense of seclusion that could only really come from living in the metropolis of London. The band played for us at our Brainchild 2012 warm-up gig at Proud Galleries, and then returned to our stage at Brainchild 2013, blowing away all who were there to witness them.  We’re really excited to see them go from strength to strength in 2014."

      bio: "Having adopted his name from Ghanaian tradition of naming after spending 6 months in Ghana, West Africa, 21 year-old Gabriel Benn aka Tuesday Born (also one half of the production duo The Busy Twist) draws as much influence from African music as he does from modern production. Tuesday Born is also the latest addition to the AD stable. As a jazz-based pianist, a producer and a vocalist; Tuesday Born creates a cocktail of african influenced soulful electronica taking a diverse and unique approach to the ever growing London electronic landscape."

      bio: "United Vibrations have arrived. Born from Inner Space, we are on a journey of cosmic proportions. Music is our vessel. A sound forged from diversity. We are united in voice and rhythm. Our sound is Cyclic. Any linear perceptions of 'genre' or 'style' do it no justice. For pragmatic reasons, we call it 12Tone. Our current location is London, England. It is here that we have been inspired by the beats and harmonies of the world. We are the product of a cultural fusion, which knows no boundaries - only possibilities. Echoes of our ancestors can be heard if you listen closely. We are the continuation of an aural tradition, which goes way back beyond recorded history. "
