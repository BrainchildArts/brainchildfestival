      name: "Nerija"
      image: "nerija.jpg"
      bio: "Nérija (pronounced ‘Ne-ree-ya’) began from a Tomorrow’s Warriors initiative which premised that many girls often start playing jazz at the same time as their male counterparts, but often do not develop at the same rate. The Warriors have therefore begun separate development sessions for young women with the aim of creating a space for them in which they do not feel intimidated by counterproductive competitiveness, or feel discouraged by perceiving jazz as a uniquely masculine art form. Nérija embodies this initiative.</p><p>However, Nérija has also begun to embody something more, represented by the choosing of their name, taken from the Hebrew name ‘Nerijah’, which means ‘lamp (or light) of God’. The focus on the concept of a light with divine power may be the common desire that binds the group beyond the confines of the warriors:</p><p>&quot;It is the search for individual strength in the face of external expectations, a strength which shows itself not in competitiveness, desire for approval, or to prove that women can play well, but in the ability to discover and remain who we are, being honest with ourselves and others when to do so is incredibly hard.</p><p>Our music is a reflection of this, our friendship, and the continual search for ‘Nérija’&quot;."
