    bio: "As he's the father of one of our main organisers, we do have a slightly biased viewpoint. But his performances at Steez and at Brainchild Festival alike have shown us how many of our contemporaries are also ready to groove to his powerful blues playing. One of Steez' inherent strengths has been the appreciation of music from so many genres, across different generations. Someone once said that his growling vocals made it sound like he had drunk a bottle of whiskey a day for years, which we're glad to say is not at all true, but they were right to pick up on the vocals for we believe they're part of what makes his performances so electrifying. He often plays a selection of open tuned bottleneck slide numbers – drawing from his love of Elmore James and Mississippi Fred McDowell – and then switches to standard tuning to deliver a selection of his own devising. Most importantly, he draws the audience in to the stories that the blues have told him, sharing the humour and pathos of these timeless human situations."

Nérija embodies this initiative.</p><p>However, Nérija has also begun to embody something more, represented by the choosing of their name, taken from the Hebrew name ‘Nerijah’, which means ‘lamp (or light) of God’. The focus on the concept of a light with divine power may be the common desire that binds the group beyond the confines of the warriors:</p><p>&quot;It is the search for individual strength in the face of external expectations, a strength which shows itself not in competitiveness, desire for approval, or to prove that women can play well, but in the ability to discover and remain who we are, being honest with ourselves and others when to do so is incredibly hard.</p><p>Our music is a reflection of this, our friendship, and the continual search for ‘Nérija’&quot;."      soundcloud: "nerijamusic/redamancy"

Music that pleasures your ears with a bass heavy yet melodic mesh of broody electronics and intricate rhythms, containing shades of everything from hip-hop to house, from soul to jazz.</p><p>In late 2012, the 22 year-old decided to self-release his first EP, 'The Stars', and it was a decision that paid off, with full support coming in widespread across the blogosphere. Since then, he has supported Bonobo on his European Tour, hit the number one spot on the Hype Machine Chart and gained continuing support from the likes of Gilles Peterson and Annie Mac as well as becoming a firm favourite of YouTube channels, Majestic Casual and SuicideSheep.</p><p>Catching Flies’ most recent single ‘Quiet Nights,’ described by Clash Magazine as ‘absolutely beautiful,’ and he is currently working on a debut album for an as of yet unannounced label, with more news to follow soon.</p><p>After all this praise and initial kudos, you sense that this is the beginning of something very special indeed. We are so excited for his sundown set at the festival!"
