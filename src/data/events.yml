With lava lamps and some very special performances, and some slightly dodgy compering from us on the mic, it was a smashing start for what was still largely our festival experiment.</p><p>Featuring music from Jamie Isaac, PALMISTRY, Cholombian, comedy and poetry by Sean Mahoney and Bridget Minamore, finished with dancing courtesy of Frozen Thumb DJs.

  desc: "These beautiful huddle ups were the first manifestations of our creative partnership with STEEZ.</p><p>Together we transformed the second floor of the Bussey Building into a forest. Having procured some furniture from freecycle, and some spare bits of trees from local tree-surgeons, we were ready to launch the 2013 festival.</p><p>Whilst the illustrators Josie Tucker, Gaurab Thakali and Lu’ay Sami drew the mural into life, and we all ate Jasper’s delicious toasties, the energy of the show was becoming more and more infectious in the hands of MVC + Sumochief (then “Yancey Boys”), Nomad Soul Collective, Off Key He-Man and all the performers who were part of the live jam at the end of the night."

During the daytime, we let the music play and the incense burn whilst exhibiting prints and artwork by Brainchild affiliated artists. By midnight the place was buzzing and full of drunken people posing for photos with painted fruit (which had begun the day as part of an installation).</p><p>Featuring live music from Haraket, Ben Hauke, Maxwell Owin + Jerkcurb, plus films by Whirlygig Cinema, poetry from Slam the Poet, James Massiah and Jack Rooke, plus Sophie Gordon’s will-blow-your-mind-amazing cakes and a jumble sale."

  desc: "After the whole team met up in the September after Brainchild #2, we realised that the festival alone was not enough - we wanted Brainchild to be more than just a three day event and to take on all kinds of projects. So, six months on, in a new and intimate space in Peckham, we held a big party to showcase new ideas and celebrate a new direction.</p><p>We gave people the opportunity to contribute their own projects, mess about with our logo (the wall was littered with various designs) and discuss the future of Brainchild. We had a huge turnout and - with the help of the Full English Kitchen running the bar and food - we jammed until four in the morning."

  desc: "Thanks to the inspiration of Pete Wright and Francesco Lo Giudice, we brought Brainchild to Bristol.</p><p>With Fran and Pete both having great ideas and connections for a line-up, we aimed for the night to bring musicians together from different parts of the UK, playing alongside each other, with the chance to play together after their sets into the early hours of the night. We have also asked along some brilliant wordsmiths and poets to bring their rhythms and flows to the music. Despite venue difficulties the night before, it worked out for the best because we ended up hooking up with Jam Jar Collective and their amazing space and giant squid tentacled decorations.</p><p>The night was filled with jamming, brass instruments, quiet moments of intense listening, a poem about the word falafel, and lots and lots of toastie eating (and cheese grating).</p><p>Featuring Harry Baker, Cecil B, Vanessa Kisuule, Amoa Mass, Capua Collective, Felix Indiana, Sumochief, Tamu Massif and James Massiah"

For our day workshop, we brought in Sophie and Zoe who we’ve been helping to run storyslam workshops in Bristol under the title ‘Speak Easy’. For the whole afternoon we lovingly shared and developed stories made from our real life experience, with the theme of ‘new beginnings’, and ‘ten minutes that changed my life’.</p><p>Then from 7pm, the main space became adorned with lights and played host to film, original composition, poetry, storytelling and live music. And it was all free entry.</p><p>Featuring Jack Attewell’s original composition on the hand-pan to Carmen Bromfield Mason’s short film, ‘Marionette’, stories told by audience members and creative-writer Tom Sanders, poems told by Zia Ahmed + Alice Walker, live music performed by Lilli Unwin/HYLA and Oscar Laurence."

  desc: "<p>On the 10th-12th of July 2015, the third Brainchild Festival will be bursting into life. So to start the new year, we launched the festival with a massive celebration and get together at Total Refreshment Centre in Dalston.</p><p>Made from discarded Christmas trees and other strange foliage, we made a small, indoor forest and asked everyone to write down ideas for the festival which were then hung on a washing line between the trees.</p><p>Over the night, the focus was on the Nubya Garcia/Sheila Maurice-Grey Quintet, Nomad Soul + James Massiah and Parshmaune, who had all made original compositions for the night, feauturing choreography, installations, poetry and re-scoring of films. The quality was breathtaking and marked a real turning point for Brainchild, having worked with these artists for months in preparation for the gig.</p><p>In between sets, poets Brother Portrait, Paul Cree, Talia Randall and Cecilia Knapp contributed beautiful stories, poems and harmonies new and old, and after the main sets were over, the stage opened up to artists and audience alik for the Steez Cafe jam. Musicians and poets from all backgrounds playing together darting from rhythm to rhythm in time with one another - it was the perfect end to the live part of the night, as we then turned to DJs Jackal Wyfreid and Maxwell Owin to help us dance the rest of the night away.</p><p>As welll as being the launch for the festival, this event was the first in a series of commissioned, interdisciplinary shows we will be doing in collaboration with Steez this year.</p><p>Thank you to all the artists who took part, and to Roma and Louise and to Nadjib le Fleurier for their wonderful installations.</p>"
