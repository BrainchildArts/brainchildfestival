  question: "What's the deal with camping?"
  answer: 
    "We’ve got a big campsite right next to the main festival area, none of the hours of walking that you have to do at big festivals! The camping area is big enough for everyone at the festival to camp together. All you need to do is bring your tent. Please bear in mind we can’t have campervans or campfires at the festival."
-
  question: "What should I bring with me?"
  answer: 
    "Essentials: your ticket and some valid ID. Brainchild is an 18+ festival and you will need this and your ticket to get your wristband and gain entry.


    
    Please do bring: things that will help you gain from the festival, so notebooks, yoga mats, cameras, instruments for the jams…
    


    Please **dont** bring any glass, fireworks or illegal substances. We have a zero tolerance approach to illegal drugs and legal highs."

  answer:
