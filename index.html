						<p class="big-txt">Welcome to Brainchild, our weekend festival with collaboration and experimentation at its heart. We are dedicated to sharing ideas and developing creativity, with a love of art and thinking from all disciplines. We want to bring your ideas and stories to life within the boundless and imaginative space of our festival.</p>

					<div class="columns">
						<p>We started this with a belief that an enormous amount of good can come out of a weekend full of performing arts, talking, dancing and meeting new friends.</p>

						<p>Run entirely by volunteers, everybody mucks in dedicating long, hard hours to build an intimate community space including four stages, installations, camping area and bar, all beautifully decorated by resident artists.</p>

						<p>Our work aims to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Develop creativity through participation and collaboration.</li>
								<li>Engage with progressive ideas from any discipline.</li>
								<li>Share visions for a more sustainable and compassionate society.</li>
								<li>Explore the creative process, not just the finished product.</li>
								<li>Build a useful network for artists and individuals to work together beyond the festival.</li>
							</ul>

						<p>We see Brainchild as a fantastic opportunity for people to try out new things, find inspiration and connect with others. Everyone camps together, and we try to blur the divisions between audiences and performers as far as possible.</p>

						<p>We are now building momentum for our third festival; we're excited for our best event yet. Whether it&rsquo;s through jamming at the Steez Cafe, taking part in open-mics, making installations or volunteering as part of the build/break team, our events are full of opportunities and we can&rsquo;t wait to meet everyone who&rsquo;ll be part of it. </p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="team" class="columns">
						<p>Brainchild is run by a team of passionate volunteers. Over the last two festivals, both artists and organisers have been incredibly generous and enthusiastic about sharing their work and time. Whether it&rsquo;s driving vans, making zines, assembling fencing, lending kit, spending endless hours on photoshop, flyering or spreading the love - it's an almighty team effort.</p>

						<p>The management and festival production is mainly undertaken by Marina Blake, Jerome Toole, Joey Valiunas, Rosie Skan, Isabel Adomakoh-Young, Zoe Hunter Gordon and Sarah Wilson. The bulk of the programming is led by Luke Newman (music), Bridget Minamore (poetry), Zoe + Rosie (theatre), Lily Bonesso (installations), Louise Colgan (dance music), Georgia Spencer-Davison (films) and Jerome + Marina (music, talks, workshops and other projects).</p>

						<p>Great bundles of thanks and credit must also go out to a whole host of individuals who&rsquo;ve contributed in a big, unquantifiable way over time. Thank you Ellen Spence, Sanjay Poyzer, Ed Ive, Erica McKoy, Phoebe Douglas, Rachel Hannah, Rachel Tookey, Tom Benn, Joel Chima (Crack In The Road), Andrew Hulme (Werdna), Josie Tucker and Joe Melhuish for their support in marketing, programming, film production, artwork and more.
				</div>

				<div id="story" class="columns">
					<p>and we wanted to build a platform and a space that allowed these ideas and these passions to flourish</p>

					<p>Brainchild set out to connect people in a way that larger festivals can't, nurturing collaboration on a personal level. We started planning the first festival in December 2011, when, amidst endless arts cuts, we wanted to show each other that realising our creative ambitions was still possible. Within six months we managed it, pulling together a fantastic program of talks, workshops, music and poetry on an incredibly shoe-string budget. What made it so special was not only the intimacy but the openness of the festival process, both online and over the weekend itself. Most of us were still teenagers at the shallow end of a learning curve, but the support we received from our artists and audience turned the event into something far bigger than ourselves.</p>

					<p>For our second festival, we constructed a temporary world in a sunny field where for 700 people, enthusiasm, creativity and conversation seemed to reverberate everywhere. The event was strengthened by working with some other groups who shared our aims. We worked closely with Steez, the (then) open mic-night in Honor Oak which led to a new space in the bar for improvised and spontaneous collaboration. It was an unforgettable, incredibly sun-burnt weekend, and we could all sense that a tangible community was taking shape around this project.</p>

					<p>Brainchild continues to thrive because of the love and investment of all who attend. It's been exciting to see the legacy of many collaborations and projects that have taken root there. Having had to miss a year to finish our various degrees, we are now working on Brainchild Festival #3, in July 2015, and cannot wait to meet all the exciting people who will be part of it.</p>

Having procured some furniture from freecycle, and some spare bits of trees from local tree-surgeons, we were ready to launch the 2013 festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst the illustrators Josie Tucker, Gaurab Thakali and Lu’ay Sami drew the mural into life, and we all ate Jasper’s delicious toasties, the energy of the show was becoming more and more infectious in the hands of MVC + Sumochief (then “Yancey Boys”), Nomad Soul Collective, Off Key He-Man and all the performers who were part of the live jam at the end of the night.">

So, six months on, in a new and intimate space in Peckham, we held a big party to showcase new ideas and celebrate a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We gave people the opportunity to contribute their own projects, mess about with our logo (the wall was littered with various designs) and discuss the future of Brainchild. We had a huge turnout and - with the help of the Full English Kitchen running the bar and food - we jammed until four in the morning.">

We have also asked along some brilliant wordsmiths and poets to bring their rhythms and flows to the music. Despite venue difficulties the night before, it worked out for the best because we ended up hooking up with Jam Jar Collective and their amazing space and giant squid tentacled decorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night was filled with jamming, brass instruments, quiet moments of intense listening, a poem about the word falafel, and lots and lots of toastie eating (and cheese grating).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring Harry Baker, Cecil B, Vanessa Kisuule, Amoa Mass, Capua Collective, Felix Indiana, Sumochief, Tamu Massif and James Massiah">

For the whole afternoon we lovingly shared and developed stories made from our real life experience, with the theme of ‘new beginnings’, and ‘ten minutes that changed my life’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then from 7pm, the main space became adorned with lights and played host to film, original composition, poetry, storytelling and live music.

A space where anyone can feel free to create, and a network of appreciative, bright and forward thinking people. Every month now, hundreds of people come together to share their love of performing, writing, composing or listening. It’s been a big journey since the days in the Honor Oak pub, but even then, there something was special and the pub was always packed. Back then Steez was run by Southpaw, and although they had played the first Brainchild and brought along a short program of poetry, it wasn’t until our second festival that we fully decided to collaborate and bring these two projects together. It was the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Newman came on board to do music programming with us in a big way. We had the idea to make the Steez Cafe, a physical space at the festival to bring forth collaboration and that openness to connect with people. The Steez Cafe appeared again at our relaunch in January 2014, and will be back even stronger than before at the 2015 festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From our chance meeting with Luke at the (since deceased) Cable nightclub in 2011, it feels almost surreal to look at how much has happened, and how inspirational the partnership has proven to be. At the moment, we are working together to launch a whole new interdisciplinary, commission-based project which will manifest in 2015, and continue to support each other in any way that we can." data-link="http://welcometosteez.com">

Our biggest collaboration to date was for our slot at LeeFest, where amongst the laughter and the head-bopping, more people were made aware of the fantastic work that C.A.L.M do, and we hopefully helped to break down a weensy bit more of the stigma that can exist around mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like us, their work hopes to empower and motivate people through creativity, restoring it as a human resource to combat negative mindsets and connect with other people.

Through our shared love of hip-hop, poetry, jazz and electronic music, she came to interview many of the musicians from our 2013 lineup on her radio show, and even made an hour-long Brainchild Special in the lead up to the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica has also spread her expertise further than the radio-waves and prompted us to set up Brainchild TV, conducting interviews with artists and crew over the 2013 festival and helping to get our first mini-documentary film, about Slam the Poet, off the ground. We know no other homegrown radio show with smoother or more vibrant playlists, or beautiful presenter." data-link="http://elektrikcave.wordpress.com/">

They are a team who we have great admiration for, and whose dedication is really remarkable. Like us, they want to explore the ways that art can bring social issues into new light, and we were very happy to have collaborated with them on ‘Cityscapes’, a fundraiser for the Homeless Film Festival." data-link="https://facebook.com/kaaarmaklub">
