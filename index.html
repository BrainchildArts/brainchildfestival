						<p>Brainchild is run by a team of passionate volunteers. Over the last two festivals, both artists and organisers have been incredibly generous and enthusiastic about sharing their work and time. Whether it&rsquo;s driving vans, making zines, assembling fencing, lending kit, spending endless hours on photoshop, flyering or spreading the love - it's an almighty team effort.</p>

						<p>The management and festival production are mainly undertaken by Marina Blake, Jerome Toole, Joey Valiunas, Rosie Skan, Isabel Adomakoh-Young, Zoe Hunter Gordon and Sarah Wilson. The programming for the festival and our events is collaborative, and obviously whilst contributing hugely to the fesitval in many ways, the main programmers are Luke Newman (music), Bridget Minamore (poetry), Zoe + Rosie (theatre), Lily Bonesso (installations), Louise Colgan (dance music), Georgia Spencer-Davison (films) and Jerome + Marina (music, talks, workshops and other projects).</p>

						<p>Great bundles of thanks and credit must also go out to a whole host of individuals who&rsquo;ve contributed in a big, unquantifiable way over time. Thank you Ellen Spence, Sanjay Poyzer, Ed Ive, Erica McKoy, Phoebe Douglas, Rachel Hannah, Rachel Tookey, Tom Benn, Joel Chima (Crack In The Road), Andrew Hulme (Werdna), Josie Tucker and Joe Melhuish for their support in marketing, programming, film production, artwork and more.

					<div id="story" class="columns">
						<p>Everything began three years ago, when a few of us got to university and started taking in all the amazing things that our friends were doing. Whether that was illustration, poetry, setting up journals or organising talks, it seemed that people were finding inspiration, and we wanted to build a platform and a space that allowed these ideas and these passions to flourish. Just as significant was the realisation that everyone was ready for the apparently near-impossible challenge of making a festival. And after that, the project just found wings.</p>

						<p>We started planning our first festival in December 2011, when, amidst endless arts cuts, we wanted to show each other that realising our creative ambitions was still possible. Surprisingly enough, within six months we managed it - we pulled together to make the festival with a fantastic program of talks, workshops, music and poetry on an incredibly shoe-string budget. Part of what we realised had made it so special was not only the intimacy but the transparency of the festival process, both online and over the weekend itself. Most of us were still teenagers at the shallow end of a learning curve, but the support we received from our artists and audience turned the event into something far bigger than ourselves.</p>

						<p>Although we hadn&apos;t initially seen this as something ongoing, it was obvious after the first one that we&rsquo;d do it again. For our second festival, we found a new site in Canterbury and some amazing new people to work with: the community that was developing around the then open-mic night Steez, in Honor Oak. Working with these musicians and poets, and many other artists in theatre, film and installations from universities across the country, we constructed a temporary world in a sunny field where for 700 people, enthusiasm, collaboration and conversation seemed to reverberate everywhere. It was an unforgettable, incredibly sun-burnt weekend, and we could all sense that a tangible community was taking shape around this project.</p>

						<p>Brainchild continues to thrive because of the love and investment of all who attend and the legacy of many collaborations and projects that have taken root there. And now, having had to miss a year to finish our various degrees, we are starting to build up to Brainchild Festival #3, in July 2015, and cannot wait to meet all the exciting people who will be part of it.</p>

					</div>

					<div id="manifesto" class="columns">
						<p class="big-txt">We are an arts organisation dedicated to sharing ideas and developing creativity. Our central project is Brainchild Festival, a three-day camping festival that welcomes arts and ideas across all disciplines and keeps collaboration and experimentation at its forefront.</p>

						<p>Run entirely by volunteers, everybody mucks in - dedicating long, hard hours to build an intimate community space including four stages, installations, camping area and bar, all beautifully decorated by resident artists.</p>

						<p>Our work aims to:
							<ul>
								<li>Develop creativity through participation and collaboration.</li>
								<li>Engage with progressive ideas from any discipline.</li>
								<li>Share visions for a more sustainable and compassionate society.</li>
								<li>Explore the creative process, not just the finished product.</li>
								<li>Build a useful network for artists and individuals to work together beyond the festival.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p>Within our little festival, we see a fantastic opportunity for everyone to try out new things, find inspiration and to connect with the others. We think opening up dialogue and providing opportunities for collaboration are important, so everyone camps together and we try to blur the divisions between audiences and performers as far as possible.</p>

						<p>We are now building the momentum for our third festival and investing time into achieving our aims through other, year-round projects. Whether it&rsquo;s through jamming at the Steez Cafe, taking part in open-mics, making installations or volunteering as part of the build/break team, our events are full of opportunities and we can&rsquo;t wait to meet everyone who&rsquo;ll be part of it. </p>

With lava lamps and some very special performances, and some slightly dodgy compering from us on the mic, it was a smashing start for what was still largely our festival experiment.">

Together we transformed the second floor of the Bussey Building into a forest. Having procured some furniture from freecycle, and some spare bits of trees from local tree-surgeons, we were ready to launch the 2013 festival. Whilst the illustrators Josie Tucker, Gaurab Thakali and Lu’ay Sami drew the mural into life, and we all ate Jasper’s delicious toasties, the energy of the show was becoming more and more infectious in the hands of MVC + Sumochief (then “Yancey Boys”), Nomad Soul Collective, Off Key He-Man and all the performers who were part of the live jam at the end of the night.">

So, six months on, in a new and intimate space in Peckham, we held a big party to showcase new ideas and celebrate a new direction. We gave people the opportunity to contribute their own projects, mess about with our logo (the wall was littered with various designs) and discuss the future of Brainchild. We had our biggest turnout to date, of audience and volunteers and - with the help of the Full English Kitchen running the bar and food - we jammed with until nearly four in the morning. The space was then rapidly turned back into a makeshift church for a service the following morning - massive thanks to everyone who that happen!">

With Fran and Pete both having great ideas and connections for a line-up, we aimed for the night to bring musicians together from different parts of the UK, playing alongside each other, with the chance to play together after their sets into the early hours of the night. We have also asked along some brilliant wordsmiths and poets to bring their rhythms and flows to the music. Although venue difficulties the night before, it worked out for the best because we ended up hooking up with Jam Jar Collective ,and their amazing space and giant squid tentacled decorations. The night was filled with jamming, brass instruments, quiet moments of intense listening, a poem about the word falafel, and lots and lots of toastie eating (and cheese grating).">

We commissioned two of our favourite artists and architects Louise Colgan and Roma Swords-McDonnell to design and build an interactive installation, and also worked with Jack Rooke from C.A.L.M.’s ‘Save the Male’, to curate a two hour spoken word and comedy set which raised awareness for their fantastic work.

For our day workshop, we brought in Sophie and Zoe who we’ve been helping to run storyslam workshops in Bristol under the name ‘Speak Easy’. For the whole afternoon we lovingly shared and developed stories made from our real life experience, with the theme of ‘new beginnings’, and ‘ten minutes that changed my life’. Then from 7pm, the main space became adorned with lights and played host to film, original composition, poetry, storytelling and live music. And it was all free entry. ">

We focused on raising money for the Homeless Film Festival, a charity dedicated to empowering the homeless through filmmaking. The night was made up of work that explored our relationship with the city, challenging its glamour and its stereotypes.

A space where anyone can feel free to create, and a network of appreciative, bright and forward thinking people. Every month now, hundreds of people come together to share their love of performing, writing, composing or listening. It’s been a big journey since the days in the Honor Oak pub, but even then, there something was special and the pub was always packed. Back then Steez was run by Southpaw, and although they had played the first Brainchild and brought along a short program of poetry, it wasn’t until our second festival that we fully decided to collaborate and bring these two projects together. It was the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Newman came on board to do music programming with us in a big way. We had the idea to make the Steez Cafe, a physical space at the festival to bring forth collaboration and that openness to connect with people. The Steez Cafe appeared again at our relaunch in January 2014, and will be back even stronger than before at the 2015 festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From our chance meeting with Luke at the (since deceased) Cable nightclub in 2011, it feels almost surreal to look at how much has happened, and how inspirational the partnership has proven to be. At the moment, we are working together to launch a whole new interdisciplinary, commission-based project which will manifest in 2015, and continue to support each other in any way that we can.&lt;/p&gt;">

It is their work with The Cabinet of Living Cinema, creating and performing new soundtracks to short films, that first attracted us to Whirlygig. The films and their re-imagined scores never failed to leave us a little awe-struck. Whirlygig have been very generous to us, kindly pointing us in the direction of filmmakers to work with for our events, and even selecting short programs of films for us to play at our events, notably the re-launch in January 2014 and Mindbaby, in May 2013. Our connection with Whirlygig puts us in better stead for developing innovative ways of incorporating film and cinema into the festival, and for this we thank them very much!">

(Campaign Against Living Miserably). Together they have taken Save the Male to many festivals, from Brainchild to Bestival. Our biggest collaboration to date was for our slot at LeeFest, where amongst the laughter and the head-bopping, more people were made aware of the fantastic work that C.A.L.M do, and we hopefully helped to break down a weensy bit more of the stigma that can exist around mental health. Like us, their work hopes to empower and motivate people through creativity, restoring it as a human resource to combat negative mindsets and connect with other people.

Our first event in Bristol had some very last minute venue changes, and these guys kindly took us in. It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened because they’re all about what we’re about, and their space is quite phenomenal, including a performance area, kitchen, recording studio, rehearsal rooms and living space.

It was great to see that a festival as well-established and renowned as LeeFest had remained so friendly and so humble. Not only has their non-corporate ethos (demonstrated beautifully by their fantastic kickstarter campaign and ‘Campfire Cabinet’) become a landmark of inspiration for us, but we’ve also been impressed by their drive to work with so many different arts organisations from across different disciplines. For 2014, we brought an installation named ‘The Pavillion’, made by Louise Colgan and Roma Swords McDonnell, and a two hour set to the Clocktower stage, which we curated with Save the Male. More collaborative projects between us two festivals are almost certainly going to be emerging next year. ">

Their ambition and their dedication to the cause have been real inspirations to us. We’ve been incredibly lucky to have their support with Brainchild, whether that’s been with marketing, or easing event stress, they have been continuously generous. Josh’s vast array of projects in music and poetry, including Benin City (our 2013 Sunday headliners), Hugh, LV, Paper Tiger, and his solo spoken word performances, are quite phenomenal, and we always hope to keep them involved with the festival. Perhaps the most special thing to come out of our relationship to date is the Howl 2.0 show, working with young poets (including James Massiah, Jack Rooke, Cecilia Knapp, Rosie Knight, Kareem Parkins Brown and Dauda Ladejobi) to re-imagine Ginsberg’s unforgettable poem, which was debuted at our 2013 festival.">

Next we knew, he and two other young fellas called Mike and Chris had begun an enterprise called Full English Kitchen, specialising in fantastic, locally sourced food, and amazing cocktails made from home-grown syrup. Their hard work at our Re:Launch in January 2014 helped hugely to make the event the success it was, and we cannot wait to have them more involved with the food at the festival.">

Erica has also spread her expertise further than the radio-waves and prompted us to set up Brainchild TV, conducting interviews with artists and crew over the 2013 festival and helping to get our first mini-documentary film, about Slam the Poet, off the ground.
