					<p class="big-txt">Welcome to Brainchild. We are a small, volunteer-led festival centred around creativity and promoting new ideas. For three days in July, we stitch together the exceptional talents and ideas of the people around us into a program of live music, spoken word, DJ sets, talks, workshops, film, theatre and installation art. Artists, crew and festival-goers camp together, all with the chance to collaborate, jam and learn something new.</p>
						
					<div class="columns">
						<p>We’ve realised that for an amazing weekend, you don’t need big names on a lineup. The atmosphere, the people you meet and the sense of discovery can be far more important, and because Brainchild’s been built up by friends of friends of friends, the atmosphere is warm, open and relaxed. It’s the perfect place to let your guard down, try things out and to discover amazing new artists.</p>
						
						<p>Together we build an intimate space including five stages, installations, camping area and bar, all beautifully decorated by resident artists. Beyond that and our lineup, it’s all up to you. Come and be part of it - volunteer, bring paints, bring instruments, bring friends. We aim for you to come away feeling that blissful mix between inspired and utterly exhausted. See you in the fields for our best festival yet.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="team" class="columns">
						<p>Brainchild is run by a team of passionate volunteers. From the beginning, artists and organisers have been incredibly generous with their time and efforts. Whether it’s driving vans, making zines, assembling fencing, lending kit, spending endless hours on photoshop, flyering or spreading the love - it’s an almighty team effort.</p>
						
						<p>The festival was started up by Marina Blake, Isabel Adomakoh-Young, Joey Valiunas, Jerome Toole, Sarah Wilson, Bridget Minamore, Lily Bonesso, Georgia Spencer-Davison and Louise Colgan. The full-time team has now grown to incorporate the lovely Luke Newman, Jade Jackman, Rosie Skan, Zoe Hunter-Gordon, Ben Skerritt, Tomo Armstead and Matthew Corless. </p>
						
						<p>Huge credit must also go out to a whole host of individuals who’ve contributed in a big, unquantifiable way over time: Ellen Spence, Sanjay Poyzer, Ed Ive, Erica McKoy, Phoebe Douglas, Rachel Hannah, Jon Ferguson, Hannah Gill, Chelia Batkin, Rachel Tookey, Robbie Wojciechowski, Tom Benn, Joel Chima (Crack In The Road), Andrew Hulme (Werdna), Josie Tucker and Joe Melhuish for their support in marketing, programming, film production, artwork and so much more.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="story" class="columns">
					<p>Brainchild set out to connect people in a way that larger festivals can't, nurturing collaboration on a personal level. We started planning the first festival in December 2011, when, amidst endless arts cuts, we wanted to show each other that realising our creative ambitions was still possible. </p>
					
					<p>Within six months we managed it, pulling together a program of talks, workshops, music and poetry on an incredibly shoe-string budget. What made it so special was not only the intimacy but the openness of the festival process, both online and over the weekend itself. Most of us were still teenagers at the shallow end of a learning curve, but the support we received from our artists and audience turned the event into something far bigger than ourselves.</p>
					
					<p>For our second festival, we made a temporary world in a sunny field where for 700 people, enthusiasm, creativity and conversation seemed to reverberate everywhere. We worked closely with Steez, the (then) open mic-night in Honor Oak which led to a new space in the bar for improvised and spontaneous collaboration. It was an unforgettable, incredibly sun-burnt weekend, and we could all sense that a tangible community was taking shape around this project.</p>
					
					<p>We soon realised that to do the best work we could, some clearer aims were in order. Together we decided that our work would aim to: </p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Develop creativity through participation and collaboration. </li>
						<li>Engage with progressive ideas from any discipline. </li>
						<li>Share visions for a more sustainable and compassionate society. </li>
						<li>Explore the creative process, not just the finished product. </li>
						<li>Build a useful network for artists and individuals to work together beyond the festival. </li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Brainchild continues to thrive because of the love and investment of all who attend. It's been exciting to see the legacy of many collaborations and projects that have taken root there. </p>
					
					<p>Having had to miss a year to finish university, Brainchild #3 is set to manifest from 10-12 July 2015 at our new home, Bentley, in Lewes. </p>

But his performances at Steez and at Brainchild Festival alike have shown us how many of our contemporaries are also ready to groove to his powerful blues playing. One of Steez&#x27; inherent strengths has been the appreciation of music from so many genres, across different generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone once said that his growling vocals made it sound like he had drunk a bottle of whiskey a day for years, which we&#x27;re glad to say is not at all true, but they were right to pick up on the vocals for we believe they&#x27;re part of what makes his performances so electrifying. He often plays a selection of open tuned bottleneck slide numbers – drawing from his love of Elmore James and Mississippi Fred McDowell – and then switches to standard tuning to deliver a selection of his own devising. Most importantly, he draws the audience in to the stories that the blues have told him, sharing the humour and pathos of these timeless human situations.</p>

The reception of the music was overwhelming and before long there was demand for &#x27;Capua&#x27; to perform. By the beginning 2013, a quintet had come together with drummer Jacob Maskell-Key, guitarist Ewan Galbraith and Louis Davidson on percussion. Over the year the groups&#x27; musically adventurous reputation grew, as did its numbers, taking onboard saxophonist Andy Heyes, vocalist Georgia Thursting and resident master of sound Pete Jones.To date, Capua Collective have played alongside artists such as Submotion Orchestra, XXYYXX and Fatima of Eglo Records, and continue to inspire audiences around the UK.</p>

Nérija embodies this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nérija has also begun to embody something more, represented by the choosing of their name, taken from the Hebrew name ‘Nerijah’, which means ‘lamp (or light) of God’. The focus on the concept of a light with divine power may be the common desire that binds the group beyond the confines of the warriors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is the search for individual strength in the face of external expectations, a strength which shows itself not in competitiveness, desire for approval, or to prove that women can play well, but in the ability to discover and remain who we are, being honest with ourselves and others when to do so is incredibly hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our music is a reflection of this, our friendship, and the continual search for ‘Nérija’&amp;quot;.</p>

Since then, he has supported Bonobo on his European Tour, hit the number one spot on the Hype Machine Chart and gained continuing support from the likes of Gilles Peterson and Annie Mac as well as becoming a firm favourite of YouTube channels, Majestic Casual and SuicideSheep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching Flies’ most recent single ‘Quiet Nights,’ described by Clash Magazine as ‘absolutely beautiful,’ and he is currently working on a debut album for an as of yet unannounced label, with more news to follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all this praise and initial kudos, you sense that this is the beginning of something very special indeed.

						<h3>How do I volunteer?</h3>
					</a>
					<div class="reveal" style="display:none;">
						<p>Want to get involved and join the team of beautiful volunteers that make Brainchild possible? Volunteering at Brainchild festival will mainly be a stewarding role. For example helping to set up the festival site, attending the car park, litter picking or bar work. They may also be other opportunities during set up to help construct in a more creative manner.</p>
<p>The volunteer system works with a ticket bond, you help out with two 3 hour shifts and one 4 hour shift and then get half of your ticket cost back at the end of the festival. Some shift patterns will start on the Thursday to help set up, if you choose to do this you get an extra day on site and then more time to enjoy your weekend. Likewise, some will end on the Monday, meaning you work less over the course of the weekend.</p>
<p>The volunteer team is brilliant to be a part of and we will try our best to put you on jobs with your friends if they volunteer too. Volunteers are an important part of Brainchild as without them the festival would not be the amazing event that it is. Therefore to show our love you are all invited to the staff party on Monday evening after the pack down to celebrate another magnificent Brainchild.</p>
<p>So dont hesitate to buy your volunteer ticket and jump on board. We would love for you to join the crew and make Brainchild 2015 truly spectacular. If you have any questions please email <strong>tomo@brainchildfestival.co.uk</strong></p>

For our day workshop, we brought in Sophie and Zoe who we’ve been helping to run storyslam workshops in Bristol under the title ‘Speak Easy’. For the whole afternoon we lovingly shared and developed stories made from our real life experience, with the theme of ‘new beginnings’, and ‘ten minutes that changed my life’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then from 7pm, the main space became adorned with lights and played host to film, original composition, poetry, storytelling and live music. And it was all free entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring Jack Attewell’s original composition on the hand-pan to Carmen Bromfield Mason’s short film, ‘Marionette’, stories told by audience members and creative-writer Tom Sanders, poems told by Zia Ahmed + Alice Walker, live music performed by Lilli Unwin/HYLA and Oscar Laurence.">

The night was made up of work that explored our relationship with the city, challenging its glamour and its stereotypes. Thanks to the incredible standard of the submissions we received, the programme kept everyone transfixed and cosy in every nook and corner of the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring films by Phoebe Boswell, Tuuli Manninen, Jez Pennington, Alex Horfshall, Denisha Anderson &amp; Amy Rose, Alex Thompson, Chima Nsoedo &amp; Belinda Zhawi,  Maxwell Owin &amp; Sam, music by Jacob Allen, poems by Bridget Minamore, o, James Massiah, and Hector Aponysus, artwork by Amy Glover, Alice Bloomfield, Jerome Toole, Flora Hastings, Joe Richardson, Sean Rohr and Luke Wright.">

So to start the new year, we launched the festival with a massive celebration and get together at Total Refreshment Centre in Dalston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made from discarded Christmas trees and other strange foliage, we made a small, indoor forest and asked everyone to write down ideas for the festival which were then hung on a washing line between the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the night, the focus was on the Nubya Garcia/Sheila Maurice-Grey Quintet, Nomad Soul + James Massiah and Parshmaune, who had all made original compositions for the night, feauturing choreography, installations, poetry and re-scoring of films. The quality was breathtaking and marked a real turning point for Brainchild, having worked with these artists for months in preparation for the gig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between sets, poets Brother Portrait, Paul Cree, Talia Randall and Cecilia Knapp contributed beautiful stories, poems and harmonies new and old, and after the main sets were over, the stage opened up to artists and audience alik for the Steez Cafe jam. Musicians and poets from all backgrounds playing together darting from rhythm to rhythm in time with one another - it was the perfect end to the live part of the night, as we then turned to DJs Jackal Wyfreid and Maxwell Owin to help us dance the rest of the night away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As welll as being the launch for the festival, this event was the first in a series of commissioned, interdisciplinary shows we will be doing in collaboration with Steez this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all the artists who took part, and to Roma and Louise and to Nadjib le Fleurier for their wonderful installations.&lt;/p&gt;">

A space where anyone can feel free to create, and a network of appreciative, bright and forward thinking people. Every month now, hundreds of people come together to share their love of performing, writing, composing or listening. It’s been a big journey since the days in the Honor Oak pub, but even then, there something was special and the pub was always packed. Back then Steez was run by Southpaw, and although they had played the first Brainchild and brought along a short program of poetry, it wasn’t until our second festival that we fully decided to collaborate and bring these two projects together. It was the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Newman came on board to do music programming with us in a big way. We had the idea to make the Steez Cafe, a physical space at the festival to bring forth collaboration and that openness to connect with people. The Steez Cafe appeared again at our relaunch in January 2014, and will be back even stronger than before at the 2015 festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From our chance meeting with Luke at the (since deceased) Cable nightclub in 2011, it feels almost surreal to look at how much has happened, and how inspirational the partnership has proven to be. At the moment, we are working together to launch a whole new interdisciplinary, commission-based project which will manifest in 2015, and continue to support each other in any way that we can." data-link="http://welcometosteez.com">

The films and their re-imagined scores never failed to leave us a little awe-struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been very generous to us, kindly pointing us in the direction of filmmakers to work with for our events, and even selecting short programs of films for us to play at our events, notably the re-launch in January 2014 and Mindbaby, in May 2013. Our connection with Whirlygig puts us in better stead for developing innovative ways of incorporating film and cinema into the festival, and for this we thank them very much!" data-link="http://whirlygigcinema.com/">

Our biggest collaboration to date was for our slot at LeeFest, where amongst the laughter and the head-bopping, more people were made aware of the fantastic work that C.A.L.M do, and we hopefully helped to break down a weensy bit more of the stigma that can exist around mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like us, their work hopes to empower and motivate people through creativity, restoring it as a human resource to combat negative mindsets and connect with other people.

It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened because they’re all about what we’re about, and their space is quite phenomenal, including a performance area, kitchen, recording studio and rehearsal rooms.

It was great to see that a festival as well-established and renowned as LeeFest had remained so friendly and so humble. Not only has their non-corporate ethos (demonstrated beautifully by their fantastic kickstarter campaign and ‘Campfire Cabinet’) become a landmark of inspiration for us, but we’ve also been impressed by their drive to work with so many different arts organisations from across different disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2014, we brought an installation titled ‘The Pavillion’, made by Louise Colgan and Roma Swords McDonnell, and a two hour set to the Clocktower stage, which we curated with Save the Male. More collaborative projects between us two festivals are almost certainly going to be emerging next year. " data-link="http://leefest.org.uk">
