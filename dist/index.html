						<p class="big-txt">Welcome to Brainchild, our weekend festival with collaboration and experimentation at its heart. We are dedicated to sharing ideas and developing creativity, with a love of art and thinking from all disciplines. We want to bring your ideas and stories to life within the boundless and imaginative space of our festival.</p>

					<div class="columns">
						<p>We started this with a belief that an enormous amount of good can come out of a weekend full of performing arts, talking, dancing and meeting new friends.</p>

						<p>Run entirely by volunteers, everybody mucks in dedicating long, hard hours to build an intimate community space including four stages, installations, camping area and bar, all beautifully decorated by resident artists.</p>

						<p>Our work aims to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Develop creativity through participation and collaboration.</li>
								<li>Engage with progressive ideas from any discipline.</li>
								<li>Share visions for a more sustainable and compassionate society.</li>
								<li>Explore the creative process, not just the finished product.</li>
								<li>Build a useful network for artists and individuals to work together beyond the festival.</li>
							</ul>

						<p>We see Brainchild as a fantastic opportunity for people to try out new things, find inspiration and connect with others. Everyone camps together, and we try to blur the divisions between audiences and performers as far as possible.</p>

						<p>We are now building momentum for our third festival; we're excited for our best event yet. Whether it&rsquo;s through jamming at the Steez Cafe, taking part in open-mics, making installations or volunteering as part of the build/break team, our events are full of opportunities and we can&rsquo;t wait to meet everyone who&rsquo;ll be part of it. </p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="team" class="columns">
						<p>Brainchild is run by a team of passionate volunteers. Over the last two festivals, both artists and organisers have been incredibly generous and enthusiastic about sharing their work and time. Whether it&rsquo;s driving vans, making zines, assembling fencing, lending kit, spending endless hours on photoshop, flyering or spreading the love - it's an almighty team effort.</p>

						<p>The management and festival production is mainly undertaken by Marina Blake, Jerome Toole, Joey Valiunas, Rosie Skan, Isabel Adomakoh-Young, Zoe Hunter Gordon and Sarah Wilson. The bulk of the programming is led by Luke Newman + Ben Skerrit (music), Bridget Minamore (poetry), Zoe + Rosie (theatre), Lily Bonesso (installations), Louise Colgan (dance music), Georgia Spencer-Davison (films) and Jerome + Marina (music, talks, workshops and other projects).</p>

						<p>Great bundles of thanks and credit must also go out to a whole host of individuals who&rsquo;ve contributed in a big, unquantifiable way over time. Thank you Ellen Spence, Sanjay Poyzer, Ed Ive, Erica McKoy, Phoebe Douglas, Rachel Hannah, Rachel Tookey, Robbie Wojciechowski, Tom Benn, Joel Chima (Crack In The Road), Andrew Hulme (Werdna), Josie Tucker and Joe Melhuish for their support in marketing, programming, film production, artwork and more.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="story" class="columns">
					<p>Brainchild set out to connect people in a way that larger festivals can't, nurturing collaboration on a personal level. We started planning the first festival in December 2011, when, amidst endless arts cuts, we wanted to show each other that realising our creative ambitions was still possible. Within six months we managed it, pulling together a fantastic program of talks, workshops, music and poetry on an incredibly shoe-string budget. What made it so special was not only the intimacy but the openness of the festival process, both online and over the weekend itself. Most of us were still teenagers at the shallow end of a learning curve, but the support we received from our artists and audience turned the event into something far bigger than ourselves.</p>

					<p>For our second festival, we constructed a temporary world in a sunny field where for 700 people, enthusiasm, creativity and conversation seemed to reverberate everywhere. The event was strengthened by working with some other groups who shared our aims. We worked closely with Steez, the (then) open mic-night in Honor Oak which led to a new space in the bar for improvised and spontaneous collaboration. It was an unforgettable, incredibly sun-burnt weekend, and we could all sense that a tangible community was taking shape around this project.</p>

					<p>Brainchild continues to thrive because of the love and investment of all who attend. It's been exciting to see the legacy of many collaborations and projects that have taken root there. Having had to miss a year to finish our various degrees, we are now working on Brainchild Festival #3, in July 2015, and cannot wait to meet all the exciting people who will be part of it.</p>

Nérija embodies this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nérija has also begun to embody something more, represented by the choosing of their name, taken from the Hebrew name ‘Nerijah’, which means ‘lamp (or light) of God’. The focus on the concept of a light with divine power may be the common desire that binds the group beyond the confines of the warriors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is the search for individual strength in the face of external expectations, a strength which shows itself not in competitiveness, desire for approval, or to prove that women can play well, but in the ability to discover and remain who we are, being honest with ourselves and others when to do so is incredibly hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our music is a reflection of this, our friendship, and the continual search for ‘Nérija’&amp;quot;."  data-sc="nerijamusic/redamancy">

A space where anyone can feel free to create, and a network of appreciative, bright and forward thinking people. Every month now, hundreds of people come together to share their love of performing, writing, composing or listening. It’s been a big journey since the days in the Honor Oak pub, but even then, there something was special and the pub was always packed. Back then Steez was run by Southpaw, and although they had played the first Brainchild and brought along a short program of poetry, it wasn’t until our second festival that we fully decided to collaborate and bring these two projects together. It was the perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Newman came on board to do music programming with us in a big way. We had the idea to make the Steez Cafe, a physical space at the festival to bring forth collaboration and that openness to connect with people. The Steez Cafe appeared again at our relaunch in January 2014, and will be back even stronger than before at the 2015 festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From our chance meeting with Luke at the (since deceased) Cable nightclub in 2011, it feels almost surreal to look at how much has happened, and how inspirational the partnership has proven to be. At the moment, we are working together to launch a whole new interdisciplinary, commission-based project which will manifest in 2015, and continue to support each other in any way that we can." data-link="http://welcometosteez.com">

People have been telling stories since the beginning of time, and although we all think we’re good listeners, it’s remarkable what giving someone the space, an engaged audience, and five, uninterrupted minutes, can create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the nights Sophie and Zoe have done with Speak Easy in Bristol, and at our Rich Mix event in August, a growing number of people are telling stories and transforming moving, difficult, poignant or beautiful parts of their past into something shared and appreciated by many." data-link="https://facebook.com/SpeakEasyStorySlam">

His sense of humour and magnetic personality almost certainly played a big part in the buzz around the bar that year, and in turn, to the general levels of insobriety amongst the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next thing we knew, he and two other young fellas called Mike and Chris had begun an enterprise called Full English Kitchen, specialising in fantastic, locally sourced food, and amazing cocktails made from home-grown syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their hard work at our Re:Launch in January 2014 helped hugely to make the event the success it was, and we cannot wait to have them more involved with the food at the festival." data-link="https://facebook.com/fullenglishkitchen">

Through our shared love of hip-hop, poetry, jazz and electronic music, she came to interview many of the musicians from our 2013 lineup on her radio show, and even made an hour-long Brainchild Special in the lead up to the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica has also spread her expertise further than the radio-waves and prompted us to set up Brainchild TV, conducting interviews with artists and crew over the 2013 festival and helping to get our first mini-documentary film, about Slam the Poet, off the ground. We know no other homegrown radio show with smoother or more vibrant playlists, or beautiful presenter." data-link="http://elektrikcave.wordpress.com/">

			<h2>Tickets</h2>
			<p class="big-txt">The sooner you buy your tickets, the better we can make the festival...</p>
      <p>We still have some spaces left for volunteers. If you come along and help out, we'll give you half the ticket money back at the end. More info <a href="#" class="info-overlay" data-img="img/contents/volunteering.jpg" data-title="Volunteering" data-desc="&lt;p&gt;Want to get involved and join the team of beautiful Volunteers that make Brainchild possible?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volunteering at Brainchild festival will mainly be a stewarding role. For example helping to set up the festival site, attending the car park, litter picking or bar work. They may also be other opportunities during set up to help construct in a more creative manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The volunteer system works with a ticket bond, you help out with two 3 hour shifts and one 4 hour shift and then get half of your ticket cost back at the end of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some shift patterns will start on the Thursday to help set up, if you choose to do this you get an extra day on site and then more time to enjoy your weekend. Likewise, some will end on the Monday, meaning you work less over the course of the weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The volunteer team is brilliant to be a part of and we will try our best to put you on jobs with your friends if they volunteer too. The working environment is fun and offers lots diversity, there will be plenty of interesting and exciting things to help out with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volunteers are an important part of Brainchild as without them the festival would not be the amazing event that it is. Therefore to show our love you are all invited to the staff party on Monday evening after the pack down to celebrate another magnificent Brainchild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#39;t hesitate to buy your volunteer ticket and jump on board. We would love for you to join the crew and make Brainchild 2015 truly spectacular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have any questions please email &lt;b&gt;tomo@brainchildfestival.co.uk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;">here</a>.</p>
